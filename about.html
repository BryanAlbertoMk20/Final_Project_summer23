      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Study Zone is a site where students can take notes and download them
          as PDFs. The goal is to provide a study environment where we promote
          persistent studying but also a place for relaxation. The more
          comfortable and relaxed when learning new material the easier it is
          for someone to absorb what they are writing down.
        </p>

      <h2 class="reveal">How It Works</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          We have a page where the student can write down their notes, and then
          save them to their computer for later while keeping track of how long
          it takes them to study. We also provide a section on our site that
          promotes relaxation by providing calming background and ambient music.
        </p>

      <h2 class="reveal">The timer and music</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          A timer is available to the student so that if they want to have
          better time management during the session, they have the option
          available. We also provide optional music that can be lowered or muted
          if needed.
